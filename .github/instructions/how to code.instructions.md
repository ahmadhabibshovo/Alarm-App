Purpose:  
This project aims to develop an alarm application that closely replicates and enhances the alarm functionality found in the default Android system Clock app. The application should enable users to set, edit, and delete alarms, configure repeat schedules, select custom alarm tones, and manage alarm notifications. The objective is to deliver a reliable, intuitive, and customizable alarm experience, matching user expectations from the built-in Android Clock app, while also supporting additional features or improvements as needed.

- Ensure all core alarm features (set, edit, delete, repeat, tone selection, notifications) are supported.
- Prioritize user experience, reliability, and customization.
- Adhere to the coding guidelines and project conventions outlined below.
- Only make changes relevant to the requested functionality or improvement.
- Provide concise explanations if requested.
# LLM Coding Guidelines

1. **Understand the Requirement**: Carefully read the user's request and any provided context or existing code.
2. **Analyze Existing Code**: If modifying code, review the current implementation to understand its logic and structure.
3. **Plan the Change**: Decide what needs to be added, removed, or changed to fulfill the requirement.
4. **Write Correct, Working Code**: Ensure all code snippets are syntactically correct and logically sound. The code should be ready to run or integrate.
5. **Modify Code Properly**: When editing existing code, only change the necessary parts. Preserve unrelated logic and formatting.
6. **Explain When Needed**: If the user asks for an explanation, provide a concise and clear description of the code or changes.
7. **Follow Project Conventions**: Adhere to any project-specific coding standards, naming conventions, and file organization.
8. **Test Your Code**: If possible, include basic test cases or usage examples to demonstrate correctness.
9. **Avoid Unnecessary Changes**: Do not refactor or alter code beyond the scope of the request.
10. **Respect Security and Privacy**: Do not include sensitive data or insecure practices in code examples.
